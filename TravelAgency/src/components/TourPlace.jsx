              <h3>The Chitrakoot Falls</h3>
              <p>
                Chitrakoot Falls is fondly known as the "Niagara Falls of
                India". Now what is so great about this place that it has been
                compared to the most magnanimous and beautiful waterfall in the
                world? Located in the Bastar district of Chattisgarh, Chitrakoot
                Falls is a spectacular natural beauty. It falls from a height of
                95 ft and is almost as wide as 985 ft, which is one-third of the
                glorious Niagara Falls. Due to this, it is the widest waterfall
                in India. From a distance, the falls looks so dreamy that you
                might never be able to take your eyes off it!{" "}
